so many occasions, this charming girl got a contribution, with Old Lady
Flanagan calling out from a front window:-
“Good luck, Lucy darlin’! I’m sorry I was so dom cranky!”
But though popular opinion was in favor of having a zoo, popular opinion didn’t hand in
donations to within four thousand dollars of what it would cost to install; and Gadsby and
his “gang” had to do a bit of brain racking, so as not to disappoint lots of good folks who
had paid in. Finally, Sarah Young thought of a rich woman living just across from City
Park. This woman, Lady Standish, was of that kind, loving disposition which would bring
in a cold, hungry, lost pup, or cat, and fill it up with hot food and milk. Branton Hills kids
could bring any kind of a hurt or sick animal or bird; and Sarah had long known that that
back yard was, actually, a small zoo, anyway; with dogs, cats, poultry, two robins too
young to fly, four sparrows and a canary, almost bald. Sarah thought that any woman,
loving animals as Lady Standish did, might just thrill at having a big zoo-ful right at hand.
So, saying, “I’ll go and find out, right now”, was off as an arrow from a bow. As soon as
this kindly woman found out what was on Sarah’s mind, our young solicitor got a loving
kiss, with:— “A zoo! Oh! how truly charming! What grand things Mayor Gadsby can think
up without half trying!” And Sarah had to grin, thinking of Lucy, and Old Lady Flanagan’s
opinion of His Honor! “You may not know it, Sarah,” said Lady Standish, “but John
Gadsby and I had a big flirtation, way back in our school days. And HOW downcast poor
Johnny was at my finding a husband out of town! But that was long, long ago, darling. So,
just to sort of pacify my old pal, John, I’ll gladly put up your missing four thousand; and
you go to His Honor and say that I wish him all sorts of good luck with this plan.”
Now, Olympic champions must train continuously, but, customarily, in gymnasiums. But
today, folks in Branton Hills’ shopping


h cannot maintain that good physical condition paramount in carrying on a city’s
various forms of labor? And not only physical good, but also a mind happy from lack of
worry and of that stagnation which always follows a monotonous daily grind. So our
Organization was soon out again, agitating City Officials and civilians toward building a
big Auditorium in which all kinds of shows and sports could occur, with also a swimming
pool and hot and cold baths. Such a building cannot so much as start without financial
backing; but gradually many an iron-bound bank account was drawn upon (much as you
pull a tooth!), to buy bonds. Also, such a building won’t grow up in a night; nor was a spot
upon which to put it found without a lot of agitation; many wanting it in a down-town
district; and also, many who had vacant land put forth all sorts of claims to obtain cash for
lots upon which a big tax was paid annually, with-out profits. But all such things
automatically turn out satisfactorily to a majority; though an ugly, squawk that “municipal
graft” was against him.
Now Gadsby was vigorously against graft; not only in city affairs but in any kind of
transaction; and that stab brought forth such a flow of oratory from him, that as voting for
Mayor was soon to occur, it, and a long list of good works, soon had him up for that
position. But Gadsby didn’t want such a nomination; still, thousands of towns-folks who
had known him from childhood, would not hark to anything but his candidacy; and, soon,
on window cards, signs, and flags across Broadway, was his photograph and “GADSBY
FOR MAYOR”; and a campaign was on which still rings in Branton Hills’ history as “hot
stuff!” Four aspiring politicians ran in opposition; and, as all had good backing, and
Gadsby only his public works to fall back on, things soon got looking gloomy for him. His
antagonists, standing upon soap box, auto truck, or hastily built platforms, put forth, with
