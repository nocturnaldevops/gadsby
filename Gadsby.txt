"A small town with a grand outlook. A town rich with history, growth, and a strong spirit of unity. A town with grand parks, solid roads, good folks, and an outstanding outlook. A town of unity, of activity, of bustling shops and busy lanes. Young lads rush through the town, folks talk of grand works and plans to expand. Many proud citizens walk proudly down this road, for this is a town of triumph and triumphs to come."
